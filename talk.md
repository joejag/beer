# Overview

* Ingredients (water, malt, hops, yeast)
* Styles (during ingredients)
* Equipment (brew day, bottling day)
* Technique (brew day, fermentation, conditioning, bottling day)
* Alternatives (3 vessel, keg or cask)
* Mistakes (write stuff down)

# Props:

* Malt, Hops, Yeast (beer and baker).
* Cup, nylon bag.
* Bottler, bottle, caps.
* Hydrometer, sugar water

# Ingerdients

* Third most drunk beverage drunk in the world after water and tea.
* It is a feremented beverage like wine and cider. Which means you extract sugars from a starch source like grapes, or a cereal and add yeast. The yeast create alcohol and carbon dioxide until the sugars are eaten.
* Beer is made from 4 Ingredients (water, malt, hops, yeast)

## water

* Each region has different mineral compounds in their water. Dublin & London has hard water better for stouts. Pizen like Glasgow has soft water better for making lagers, Burton has a lot of Gypsum in the water which helps hop flavour so is good for IPAs..

* You can treat water to remove or add minerals. We are lucky in Glasgow and the north east of England that we can just add minerals to water to get a desired level. Glasgow water contains 10x less than the definition for "soft water".

* Doesn't directly affect flavour, but acts on the flavours from the ingredients.

## Starch source

* The starch provides the fermentable material that defines how strong ABV the beer will be. Beer is usually grain.
* Grain is kilned (add water to germinate, stop it, heat it -> the heat defines the colour)
* Other grains can be added like Wheat, Rice, Oats, Rye, Corn (cheaper)
* This defines the colour of the beer and mouthfeel.

* Flavours:
* Standard: grainy, corn, bready, saltine cracker, and husky
* Crystal: caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, and burnt sugar
* Darkest: roasted, burnt, smoky, chocolate, and coffee.

## Hops

* These are used for bittering, and to improve the flavouring and aroma.
* Malt is very sweet, we use hops to give it a balanced flavour
* For people who say they donâ€™t like beer, hop bitterness is the most commonly identified reason.
* What happens with a hop depends on when it's added.

* Hop flavours: Floral, fruity, citrus, herbal, earthy, piney and spicy

* Malt forward beers: Scotch Ale, Vienna. Hop forward: IPA.

## Yeast

* Yeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer.
* Yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains, which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide, and thereby turns wort into beer.
* In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.
* Yeast is either top fermenting (ale) or bottom fermenting (lager).
* Before we understood Yeast, wild yeast got to beer, in Belgium they still do this to create sour beers. Which also have fruit added to them.


# Technique

* __Before__: Decide recipe, buy ingredients

* __Brew day__
* Prepare Equipment (clean)
* Dry Area: BIAB bag, 1L & 1/2L Pyrex, malt/hop glass, electronic scales, cake rack
* Wet Area: Fermentor with lid & airlock. Wort chiller, refractometer, metal sieve, towels, brew sheet
* Flame Area: Stockpot, lid, ruler, mash paddle, digital thermometer

* Pre Mash: Add water, treat with Camden & Gypsum. Raise temp to 2C above strike temp (68C). turn off heat. Add cake rack and bag.
* Mash: Pour grain in. Keep it at that temperature for 90 minutes. Check gravity. Flame off. Remove and squeeze bag.
* Boil: Go to 100C. Add bitterng hops, Add flavour hops, Add aroma hops, Add fining agent. Flame out.
* Cooling: Add wort chiller, bring wort to 2C above yeast guidelines.
* Fermentation: Move wort to FV. Aerate for 5 minutes. Add yeast. Seal container. Keep temp controlled for two weeks.

* __Bottling__:
* Prepare Equipment (clean, sanitize)
* Bottles, Capper, Bottle caps, Siphon , Bottling bucket, bottling wand, bottle tree, Vinator
* Sanitize everything
* Put Starsan in vinator with boilng water
* Clean each bottle, then put onto bottle tree
* Boil water for disolving sugar (3 times the sugar volume), then add sugar, stir then reduce heat
* Take a hydrometer reading for FV
* Use Siphon to take beer from primary to bollting bucket
* Once started, add the cooled sugar water
* Attach bottling wand to bottling bucket
* Batch fill the bottles
* Cap all the bottles
* Clean everything ready for the next brew
