* Flame Area: Stockpot, lid, ruler, mash paddle, digital thermometer
* Ingredients: Malt, Hops, Yeast
 
# Pre-Mash

* Add Water to kettle
* Flame on
* Raise temperature to 2 degress above strike temp
* Flame off
* Add Cake rack
* Add BIAB bag

# Mash

* Check time, this is mash starting time
* Check temp, Add lid if within 2C. Remove lid if high, other put lid on. If too low heat and move.
* Check temp at 5, 10, 20, 40, 70
* Finished afer 90 minutes
* (Optional) Mash Out
* Flame on

Write down mistakes at this point. Get hops and bits ready with notes for when they are added.

# The Boil

* Flame on to 100C (sweet liquor becomes wort at 100c)
* Flame out at 100C
* Check Gravity and volume
* Flame on
* 30 minutes making sure the temp is steady. Empty grains and clean bag
* 30 minutes in: Add bittering hops (can boilover, watch out)
