# Malt!

The color of malt is described in degrees Lovibond (Â°L). Malt, unqualified, always means malted barley.

Barley gives beer its color, underlying flavor, sweetness, body, head of foam, and mouthfeel


# Malting

Malting is the process of sprouting and drying a grain seed.

The malting process involves 

* wetting the grain
* letting it germinate
* dry it,
* knock off the roots. then 
* kiln to roast it to a desired leve


The germination process converts starch, the seed's stored energy, into simpler sugars used in its initial growing stage. The conversion of starch to sugar is accomplished by diastase enzymes that the seed produces during this process. The germination and drying stages capture fermentable sugars, soluble starch, and the diastase enzymes for beer brewing. 

# Chemistry

The body of a beer if based off whether [Alpha or Beta amylase](http://beersmith.com/blog/2012/12/20/mash-temperature-and-beer-body-in-all-grain-brewing/) is prioritised. 

Alpha is less fermentable by yeast. Beta is very fermentable.

Beta comes out at 63-66C resulting in light body. Alpha and Beta play at 65-67C for medium. Alpha at 68-69C give less fermentable sugars, resulting in less alcohol, but more body. 


For a [fuller body](http://beersmith.com/blog/2008/02/27/making-full-body-beer-at-home/): Use more Carmelized and Roasted Malts. Add Unmalted Grains. Use a Higher Mash Temperature. Use a Low Attenuation Yeast Strain

Details on each malt is available from [byo](https://byo.com/resources/grains)

## Base Malt

These make up most of the grist. Basics covered well on [serious eats](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/11/what-does-pilsner-malt-taste-like-munich-vienna-2-row.html)

Examples: 

* US Pale Malt (Diadastic-coverts to sugar easily, for 2 row pale malt-crackers,grain,honey, for 6 row-less flavour)
* British Pale Malt (Maris Otter, darker than US and more flavourful)
* Pilsner (not just used in Pilsner, Belgian strong. Honey, grainy taste)
* wheat (sometimes added to other beers for head retention)

##  Speciality Malt 

These malts add color, flavor and body to your brew

Examples: Carapils (head retention), Honey malt (sweet nutty), Munich (adds body, aroma, malt sweetness), Raunch (smoked), Rye (spicy, nutty), special roast (toast, biscuit), victory (for nut brown ales, nutty), Vienna (a lesser Munich, rich biscuit, toasted)

##  Crystal malts

malting to caramelise the malt giving better head retention, body, and sweeter taste (caramel/toffee in darker)

Examples: Caravienne (Belgian, sweet & toast), Carastan (British version), Caramunich (darker Caravienne)

##  Roasted Malt 

dark for porters, kilned at high temp, they do not contain enzymes

Examples: Chocolate malt (bitter chocolate), Black patent malt (burnt, very dark), Black roasted barley (unmalted, very strong, bitter, burnt flavor, helps head retention)

##  Adjuncts 

* With extra sugars: Belgian candi sugar (extra ABV & crispness), Corn (sweetness), Honey (depends on Honey flavour)
* Flaked: Barley (for stouts, head retention), Maize (lightens pilsner body), Wheat (cloudyness, head retention)
* Oats (silky, adds fat, oil and proteins)
* Rice (no taste, makes crisp or dry)
