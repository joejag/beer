# Hops!

The bittering, flavor, and aroma characteristics of hops are created by a two major types of chemical compound contained in the cone-shaped hop flower: __acids__ and __oils__. 

# Chemistry

[Home Brew Talk on Alpha Acids](http://www.homebrewtalk.com/wiki/index.php/Alpha_acids)

A beer needs bitterness for balance, but it needs flavor and aroma to be unique

### Acids

Alpha acids (humulone, adhumulone, and cohumulone), which form iso-alpha acids in the boil

Beta acids, which are the hop's essential oils (primarily humulene, myrcene, caryophyllene and farnesene).

Alpha goes bitter in the boil, Beta during fermentation.

Oils come out straight away in a boil, acids take time. This is why they are added at the start of the boil.

__Cohumulone__: Traditionally avoided for harness, used a lot more now

### Oils

Flavour hops are added 15 minutes before end of boil. Aroma during the last 5 minutes.

More on oils at [the hop yard](http://thehopyard.com/hops-hydrocarbons/).

__Myrcene__: (usually 20-65%) US over European preference. *__Citrus fruits__*. When added late in, or after, the boil, myrcene adds the intense, pungent aroma associated with American dry-hopped beers. When boiled for longer periods, it yields the characteristic *__citrus and pine aromas__* of American craft beer.

The predominate aroma contribution of this oil is a pungent __*floral*__ quality, with a much smaller, but also present citrus and piney character. To the flavor is adds a __*orange, earthy*__ character. Disappears fast, best for dry hopping.

__Humulene__: (usually 15-45%) Noble, comes out in dry hopping, if boiled for longer periods, humulene lends the finished beer an *__herbal or spicy__* character. It brings a elegant __*woody and herbal*__ character to a beers aroma, but is best known for the __*spicy*__ flavor it impacts.  Also used as bittering hops when a very subtle __*spiciness*__ is desired.

__Caryophyllene__: (usually 5-15%) adds a __*spicy, herbal*__ character similar to humulene when boiled. Unknown when fresh

__Farnesene__: (usually 1%, up to 20% in Noble hops) Known to impart a __*woody and earthy*__ character to beers, hops with Farnesene tend to be best used in late boil or during dry hopping.
