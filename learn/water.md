# Things to note:

* Calcium (Ca)
* Magnesium (Mg)
* Sodium (Na)
* Carbonate (CO3)
* Sulphate (SO4)
* Chloride (Cl)

# Water report for my area

* Total Hardness: Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3): 17.4 mg/l
* Magnesium (Mg): Not monitored
* Sodium (Na): 3.9 mg/l
* Sulphate (SO04): 11.4 mg/l
* Chrloride (CI): 7.9 mg/l

Short form: Ca 7, Mg ?, Na 4, SO4 11, CI 8, HCO3 21, CaCO3 17.5

# Additivies

* Gypsum (Calcium Sulfate): Increase Sulphates. Lowers PH.
* Epsom Salt (Magnesium Sulfate): Like Gypsum, but less PH reduction
* Chalk (Calcium Carbonate): Raises pH. Use for making dark beers in areas of soft water
* Dihydrate (Calcium Chloride): Lowers pH

# For Style:

* IPA: Add 5g Gypsum during mash

# Jim recommends for 20 litres

http://www.jimsbeerkit.co.uk/water/water.html

* Total Calcium Sulphate (CaSO4*2) (Gypsum): 9.29 grams
* Total Calcium Chloride (CaCl2*2) (Dihydrate): 4.84 grams
* Total Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO4*7) (Epsom salts): 3.04 grams
* Total Sodium Chloride (NaCl) (common salt): 1.33 grams
* Total Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) (as chalk): 0.15 grams

Treating to get IPA water: http://beerandwinejournal.com/two-water-guides/ (50 ppm calcium, 25 ppm chloride and 80 ppm sulfate (for a chloride to sulfate ratio of 1:3.2).)
